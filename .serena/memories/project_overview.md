# CodeAgent Project Overview

## Purpose
CodeAgent is a cross-platform .NET 8 command-line AI coding assistant that integrates with multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Claude, Ollama). It serves as a local, privacy-focused alternative to cloud-based coding assistants, providing intelligent code analysis, modification, and development assistance.

## Key Features
- Multiple LLM provider support (OpenAI, Claude, Ollama)
- Interactive chat interface with markdown rendering
- Project file scanning and analysis
- Configurable provider settings
- Rich terminal UI with Spectre.Console
- Command history and persistence
- Model Context Protocol (MCP) support
- Pipe input support for automation

## Mission
To create a flexible, extensible, and user-friendly coding agent that democratizes access to AI-powered development tools across different LLM providers, programming languages, and development workflows.

## Current Status
The project is functional with a working CLI, interactive shell, and basic file operations. The core architecture is established with proper separation of concerns following Clean Architecture principles.
