# Phase 4: Advanced Security & Enterprise Features

## Overview
Phase 4 introduces enterprise-grade security features and compliance capabilities to meet organizational requirements for secure AI-assisted development.

## Key Components

### 1. Security Hardening & Compliance
- Code signing for distributed binaries
- SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) generation
- Vulnerability scanning integration
- Compliance reporting (SOC2, ISO27001 readiness)
- Security policy templates for organizations

### 2. Advanced Sandboxing & Isolation
- Container-based execution environment
- WebAssembly (WASM) runtime for untrusted code execution
- Network isolation controls
- Resource consumption limits (CPU, memory, disk I/O)
- Filesystem virtualization layer

### 3. Enterprise Security Controls
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Active Directory / LDAP integration
- Multi-factor authentication support
- Session timeout and automatic lockout
- Centralized policy management

### 4. Advanced Threat Protection
- Real-time malware scanning of generated code
- Behavioral analysis of AI suggestions
- Anomaly detection for unusual file access patterns
- Integration with enterprise security tools (SIEM, EDR)
- Automated incident response workflows

### 5. Data Loss Prevention (DLP)
- Sensitive data detection (API keys, credentials, PII)
- Data classification and labeling
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Data residency compliance
- Automatic redaction of sensitive information

### 6. Audit & Compliance Infrastructure
- Immutable audit trails
- Compliance dashboard and reporting
- Automated policy violation detection
- Integration with governance tools
- Digital forensics support for incident investigation

## CLI Commands

### Security & Compliance Commands
```bash
codeagent security audit               # Comprehensive security audit
codeagent security policies            # Show active security policies
codeagent security scan --deep         # Deep threat analysis
codeagent compliance check <standard>  # Check compliance (SOC2, ISO27001)
```

### Sandbox Management Commands
```bash
codeagent sandbox status               # Show sandbox environment status
codeagent sandbox enable               # Enable sandbox mode
codeagent sandbox disable              # Disable sandbox mode
codeagent sandbox logs                 # View sandbox activity logs
```

### Access Control Commands
```bash
codeagent rbac list                    # List role-based access controls
codeagent rbac assign <user> <role>    # Assign role to user
codeagent rbac policy <name>           # Apply security policy
```

### Enterprise Management Commands
```bash
codeagent org policy list              # List organization policies
codeagent org policy apply <name>      # Apply organization policy
codeagent org users                    # List organization users
codeagent org audit <period>           # Generate organization audit report
```

### Data Protection Commands
```bash
codeagent dlp scan                     # Data loss prevention scan
codeagent dlp classify <file>          # Classify data sensitivity
codeagent dlp report                   # Generate DLP compliance report
```

### Threat Detection Commands
```bash
codeagent threat status                # Show threat detection status
codeagent threat history               # Show threat detection history
codeagent threat respond <id>          # Respond to security incident
```

## Implementation Status
- Phase 4 requirements are documented and planned
- Phase 4.1-4.5 (non-security features) have been implemented in the current codebase
- Security and enterprise features from the updated Phase 4 requirements are pending implementation
- Current implementation includes: multi-provider support, context management, plugin system, interactive mode, and performance monitoring

## Next Steps for Phase 4 Security Implementation
1. Implement RBAC system with user/role management
2. Add sandboxing with container or WASM isolation
3. Integrate DLP scanning for sensitive data
4. Build audit logging infrastructure
5. Add compliance reporting capabilities
6. Implement threat detection and response
7. Add enterprise policy management
8. Integrate with AD/LDAP for authentication
