# Code Agent Project Status

## Project Overview
The Code Agent System is a comprehensive development assistant platform that integrates multiple LLM providers through a unified interface, accessible via web portal, CLI, and IDE integrations.

**Key Design Principle:** Zero-configuration by default. Users can start immediately with just a provider configured. Advanced features (custom agents, workflows) are optional.

## Update Instructions
**IMPORTANT:** When working on a phase, the agent should:
1. Update the phase status in this file (Not Started → In Progress → Completed)
2. Check off completed tasks using [x]
3. Only reference supporting docs when needed for that specific feature
4. Keep updates minimal and focused on status changes only

## Metrics
- Total Phases: 10
- Completed: 6
- In Progress: 0
- Not Started: 4
- Overall Progress: 60%
