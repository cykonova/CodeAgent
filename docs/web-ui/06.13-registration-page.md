# Phase 06.9: Registration Page

## Overview
Create the registration page component with Material Design form controls, implementing user account creation with validation and secure credential handling.

## Goals
- Build Material Design registration form
- Implement comprehensive form validation
- Handle account creation flow
- Support password strength indicator
- Provide real-time validation feedback

## Component Structure

### File Organization
The registration feature should be organized as a standalone component within the authentication module:
- Registration component (TypeScript, HTML, SCSS, and spec files)
- Custom password strength validator utility
- Shared authentication service for account creation
- Integration with email verification system

### Component Dependencies
- Angular Material form components (Card, Form Field, Input, Button, Icon, Progress Bar, Checkbox, Tooltip)
- Reactive Forms with custom validators
- Router for post-registration navigation
- Snackbar for success/error notifications

## User Interface Design

### Layout Structure
The registration page should center a Material card containing the registration form. The card should have:
- Header section with title "Create Account" and subtitle "Join Code Agent to start building"
- Multi-field form section with validation indicators
- Terms acceptance checkbox
- Footer section with link to login page

### Form Fields

#### Name Fields
- Split first and last name into two fields
- Side-by-side layout on desktop, stacked on mobile
- Material outline appearance with person icon
- Minimum length validation (2 characters)
- Required field indicators

#### Email Field
- Full-width Material input with email icon
- Real-time email format validation
- Check for existing account (async validation)
- Clear error messages for invalid formats
- Placeholder with example format

#### Password Field
- Material outline appearance with lock icon
- Password visibility toggle button
- Real-time strength calculation
- Dynamic hint text with requirements
- Info icon with detailed tooltip

#### Password Strength Indicator
- Color-coded progress bar below password field
- Four strength levels: Weak (red), Fair (orange), Good (yellow), Strong (green)
- Percentage-based calculation considering:
  - Length (minimum 8, bonus for 12+)
  - Character variety (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special)
  - Common pattern detection
- Text label showing current strength level

#### Confirm Password Field
- Material outline appearance with lock outline icon
- Real-time matching validation
- Visibility toggle independent of main password
- Clear mismatch error message

#### Terms and Conditions
- Material checkbox with inline links
- Links open in new tab to terms and privacy policy
- Required validation with error message
- Proper spacing and typography for readability

## Registration Flow

### Form Validation Strategy

#### Field-Level Validation
Implement immediate feedback for each field:
- First/Last Name: Required, minimum 2 characters
- Email: Required, valid format, async uniqueness check
- Password: Required, minimum 8 characters, strength requirements
- Confirm Password: Required, must match password
- Terms: Must be accepted

#### Cross-Field Validation
- Password confirmation matching
- Real-time validation updates
- Clear visual indicators for valid/invalid states
- Helpful error messages with actionable guidance

### Password Strength Requirements
Enforce strong password policy:
- Minimum 8 characters (required)
- Contains uppercase letter
- Contains lowercase letter
- Contains number
- Contains special character
- Not a common password pattern
- Visual feedback through progress bar

### Submit Process
1. Perform final validation check
2. Display loading spinner
3. Disable form during submission
4. Call registration API endpoint
5. Handle success with verification message
6. Handle errors with specific feedback
7. Navigate to appropriate next step

### Post-Registration Flow
After successful registration:
- Display success message with email verification notice
- Redirect to login page
- Pre-fill email field if possible
- Show banner about verification email
- Provide resend verification option

## Service Integration

### Registration Service
Extend authentication service to handle:
- Registration API call with user details
- Email uniqueness validation
- Password strength calculation
- Verification email triggering
- Error response handling
- Success state management

### Validation Services
Create reusable validators for:
- Password strength calculation
- Email format and uniqueness
- Name field validation
- Custom async validators
- Cross-field validation logic

### Email Verification
Implement verification system:
- Send verification email on registration
- Handle verification token validation
- Resend verification option
- Expiration handling
- Success/error feedback

## Styling Approach

### Theme Integration
- Consistent use of Material Design principles
- CSS variables for colors and spacing
- Support for light/dark themes
- Proper elevation and shadows
- Smooth transitions and animations

### Responsive Layout
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Flexible form field arrangement
- Touch-friendly input sizes
- Appropriate spacing for different screens
- Readable font sizes across devices

### Visual Hierarchy
- Clear primary action (Create Account)
- Secondary actions properly styled
- Visual grouping of related fields
- Consistent spacing using theme variables
- Proper contrast ratios

### Progress Indicators
- Color-coded password strength bar
- Loading states during async operations
- Field validation checkmarks
- Error state highlighting
- Smooth state transitions

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- Client-side input sanitization
- HTTPS-only form submission
- No password logging or storage
- Secure token generation
- Rate limiting protection

### Password Security
- Enforce strong password requirements
- Never send passwords in plain text
- Salt and hash on backend
- Prevent common passwords
- Secure password strength algorithm

### Account Security
- Email verification required
- CAPTCHA for bot protection (optional)
- Rate limiting on registration attempts
- Duplicate account prevention
- Suspicious activity monitoring

## Accessibility Requirements

### Form Accessibility
