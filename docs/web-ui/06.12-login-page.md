# Phase 06.8: Login Page

## Overview
Create the login page component with Material Design form controls, implementing authentication flow and secure credential handling.

## Goals
- Build Material Design login form
- Implement form validation
- Handle authentication flow
- Support remember me functionality
- Provide error feedback

## Component Structure

### File Organization
The login feature should be organized as a standalone component within the authentication module:
- Login component (TypeScript, HTML, SCSS, and spec files)
- Shared authentication service for login/logout operations
- Integration with existing auth guard for route protection

### Component Dependencies
- Angular Material form components (Card, Form Field, Input, Button, Checkbox, Icon, Progress Spinner)
- Reactive Forms for form management and validation
- Router for navigation after successful login
- Snackbar for user feedback messages

## User Interface Design

### Layout Structure
The login page should center a Material card containing the login form. The card should have:
- Header section with title "Sign In" and subtitle "Access your Code Agent workspace"
- Form section with input fields and controls
- Footer section with links to registration and password recovery

### Form Fields

#### Email Field
- Material outline appearance with email icon prefix
- Email validation with proper error messages
- Autocomplete attribute for browser password managers
- Placeholder showing example format

#### Password Field
- Material outline appearance with lock icon prefix
- Password visibility toggle button as suffix icon
- Minimum length validation (8 characters)
- Secure input masking by default

#### Remember Me Option
- Material checkbox for persistent login preference
- When checked, saves user email for next login
- Stores preference in localStorage

#### Form Actions
- Primary submit button with "Sign In" label
- Loading spinner overlay during authentication
- Disabled state when form is invalid or processing
- Link to "Forgot password?" for password recovery
- Link to registration page for new users

## Authentication Flow

### Form Validation
Implement real-time validation with clear error messages:
- Required field validation for both email and password
- Email format validation using Angular validators
- Minimum password length requirement
- Display field-specific error messages below inputs

### Submit Process
1. Validate form completeness and correctness
2. Show loading indicator and disable form
3. Call authentication service with credentials
4. Handle success/error responses appropriately
5. Navigate to dashboard on success
6. Display error message on failure

### Session Management
- Store JWT token in localStorage upon successful login
- Set user data in authentication service
- Initialize WebSocket connection with auth token
- Handle automatic redirect if already authenticated

### Remember Me Feature
When remember me is checked:
- Save user email in localStorage
- Pre-populate email field on next visit
- Clear saved email when unchecked
- Maintain security by never storing passwords

## Service Integration

### Authentication Service
Create a centralized service handling:
- Login API call with email/password
- Token storage and retrieval
- User session management
- Logout functionality
- Authentication status checking
- Automatic token refresh (if implemented)

### Route Guards
Implement authentication guard to:
- Check authentication status before route activation
- Redirect to login if not authenticated
- Store intended destination for post-login redirect
- Handle query parameters for return URL

### Error Handling
Comprehensive error handling for:
- Network failures (show connection error)
- Invalid credentials (specific error message)
- Server errors (generic error with retry option)
- Session expiration (redirect to login)
- Rate limiting (show cooldown message)

## Styling Approach

### Theme Integration
- Use CSS variables for all colors and spacing
- Support light/dark mode switching
- Follow Material Design elevation patterns
- Maintain consistent padding using theme variables

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach with breakpoints
- Stack form elements vertically on small screens
- Adjust card width for different viewports
- Ensure touch-friendly input sizes on mobile

### Visual Feedback
- Hover states for interactive elements
- Focus indicators for keyboard navigation
- Loading states during async operations
- Smooth transitions for state changes

## Security Considerations

### Input Security
- Sanitize all user inputs before submission
- Implement CSRF protection headers
- Use HTTPS-only for authentication requests
- Never store passwords in any form

### Session Security
- JWT tokens with appropriate expiration
- Secure token storage (httpOnly cookies preferred)
- Automatic logout on token expiration
- Clear sensitive data on logout

### Rate Limiting
- Implement exponential backoff for failed attempts
- Show user-friendly messages for rate limits
- Consider CAPTCHA after multiple failures
- Log suspicious activity patterns

## Accessibility Requirements

### ARIA Support
- Proper labels for all form controls
- Error announcements for screen readers
- Loading state announcements
- Keyboard navigation support

### Keyboard Navigation
- Tab order following visual hierarchy
- Enter key submits form when valid
- Escape key clears focused field
- Focus management after errors

### Visual Accessibility
- High contrast mode support
- Sufficient color contrast ratios
- Clear focus indicators
- Text alternatives for icons

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
Test coverage should include:
- Form validation logic
- Error message generation
- Remember me functionality
- Service method calls
- Navigation after login

### Integration Tests
- Full login flow with mock backend
- Error handling scenarios
- Session persistence
- Guard redirections
- WebSocket initialization

### E2E Tests
- Complete user journey from login to dashboard
- Form interaction and validation
- Error recovery flows
- Remember me persistence
- Logout functionality

## User Experience Enhancements

### Performance
- Lazy load the login module
- Minimize bundle size with tree shaking
- Implement service worker for offline message
- Cache static assets

### Convenience Features
- Auto-focus email field on load
- Smart password managers integration
- Social login options (future enhancement)
- Quick actions for common tasks

### Error Recovery
- Clear, actionable error messages
- Retry mechanisms for network failures
- Password reset flow integration
- Account recovery options

## Success Metrics

- [ ] Form validation working correctly
- [ ] Authentication flow complete
- [ ] Remember me functionality working
- [ ] Error handling implemented
- [ ] Responsive design on all devices
- [ ] Accessibility standards met
- [ ] Unit tests passing
